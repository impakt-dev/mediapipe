# Example configurations:
#
# # OpenCV 3
# To configure OpenCV 3, obtain the path of OpenCV 3 from Homebrew. The
# following commands show the output of the command with version 3.4.16_10:
#
# $ brew ls opencv@3 | grep version.hpp
# $ /opt/homebrew/Cellar/opencv@3/3.4.16_10/include/opencv2/core/version.hpp
#
# Then set path in "macos_opencv" rule in the WORKSPACE file to
# "/opt/homebrew/Cellar" and the PREFIX below to "opencv/<version>" (e.g.
# "opencv/3.4.16_10" for the example above).
#
# # OpenCV 4
# To configure OpenCV 4, obtain the path of OpenCV 4 from Homebrew. The
# following commands show the output of the command with version 4.10.0_12:
#
# $ brew ls opencv | grep version.hpp
# $ /opt/homebrew/Cellar/opencv/4.10.0_12/include/opencv4/opencv2/core/version.hpp
# $ /opt/homebrew/Cellar/opencv/4.10.0_12/include/opencv4/opencv2/dnn/version.hpp
#
# Then set path in "macos_opencv" rule in the WORKSPACE file to
# "/opt/homebrew/Cellar" and the PREFIX below to "opencv/<version>" (e.g.
# "opencv/4.10.0_12" for the example above). For OpenCV 4, you will also need to
# adjust the include paths. The header search path should be
# "include/opencv4/opencv2/**/*.h*" and the include prefix needs to be set to
# "include/opencv4".

# The path to OpenCV is a combination of the path set for "macos_opencv"
# in the WORKSPACE file and the prefix here.
# PREFIX = "opt/opencv@3"
